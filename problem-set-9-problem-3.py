# Module 6 - Problem Set No. 9 - Problem 3

"""
READ ALL INFORMATION CAREFULLY AND THEN READ IT AGAIN

IMPORTANT - PROVIDE AN IPO (Inputs, Processes, and Output) AT THE TOP OF 
EACH PROGRAM USING COMMENTS.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of single-digit numbers 
with nothing separating them. Use input() for this since we want to have a 
string of numbers. The program should display the sum of all the single digit 
numbers in the string. For example, if the user enters 2514, the method 
should return 12, which is the sum of 2, 5, 1 and 4. You can use input() to 
get the numbers as a string and then use Python coding to convert them to 
numbers as needed.

HINTS
========================
- Iterate through each character in the string using a loop. See video in 
  Canvas.
- Use a loop and use range(len(theString)) for your loop
- Remember that as you iterate through the loop, the iterator value can be 
  used to slice into the string
- Convert the string to a numeric value using int()
- Use the accumulator pattern to sum the numbers. See video in Canvas.

IPO
==========
INPUTS: a series of numbers
PROCESSES: adds them all up
OUTPUTS: outputs the sum off the numbers
